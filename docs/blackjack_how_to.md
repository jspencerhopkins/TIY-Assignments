# How to to play Blackjack

### Ojective
* The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21.  
* You compute your score by adding values of your individual cards.

### Deck
52 cards
* (4) Twos
* (4) Threes
* (4) Fours
* (4) Fives
* (4) Sixes
* (4) Sevens
* (4) Eights
* (4) Nines
* (16) "10s" (tens, jacks, queens, kings)
* (4) "11s" (aces)



### Players
Dealer vs Player

### Deal
SHUFFLE CARDS.  At the the start of a blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each.  Player only knows one of the dealer's cards - the other is face-down (hidden)
* If players cards total 21 points (blackjack), then player wins. Unless....
* If dealer also has blackjack, game ends in a push (a tie)

### Player's turns
After deal, the game moves forward with the player taking action.
The player can keep his hand as it is (stand) or take more cards from the deck (hit), one at a time, until either the player judges that the hand is strong enough to go up against the dealer's hand and stands, or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses(busts).

### Dealer's turn
After player has finished their actions, either decided to stand or busted, the dealer shows the hidden hole card.
If dealer has blackjack, he won't take any more cards - and either wins or ties player
If the dealer doesn't have a natural (11 + 10) blackjack, he hits (takes mroe cards) or stands depending on the value of the hand.
Contrary to the player, though, the dealer's action is completely dictated by the rules.
The dealer must hit if the value of the hand is lower than 17, otherwise the dealer will stand.
If dealer goes bust, player wins.
