### Players
Dealer vs Player

### Deal
At the the start of a blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each.
* If players cards total 21 points (blackjack), then player wins. Unless....
* If dealer also has blackjack, game ends in a push (a tie)
* If dealer has blackjack, player loses

### Player turns
After deal, the game moves forward with the player taking action.
The player can keep his hand as it is (stand) or take more cards from the deck (hit), one at a time, until either the player judges that the hand is strong enough to go up against the dealer's hand and stands, or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses(busts).
